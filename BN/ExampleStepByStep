Unzip the file SoftwareForPaper.zip

You should find four different folders:
GaussianScores
GaussianScoresIntervention
MCMCOrder
DGeUGe
RelevanceNetworks

****************
MCMC Order
****************

First of all go to the folder GaussianScores and open the file
exampleGaussianScores.m
When you execute this file you will be calculating the BGe scores
for the first data set that was generated from a multivariate gaussian.
This scores are then saved in a file called SCORESexample.mat

The second step is to run the MCMC.
Go to the folder MCMCOrder and open the file ExampleMCMCOrder.m
This file will run the order MCMC and will provide a file called
ResultsExample where all the MCMC results are stored.

The third and last step is to go to the folder DGEUGE and run
the file exampleDGEUGE.
This will load the results and provide the AUC values and ROC curves
for DGE and UGE.


*********************
Relevance Networks
*********************
Open the folder RelevanceNetoworks.
See the file ExampleRNs.m for and example.
