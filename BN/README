*********************************************
Calculating BGe Scores Without Interventions.
*********************************************
You find the matlab files for this task in the folder GaussianScores.

First of all it is necessary to calculate the BGe scores as a pre-step and 
save this scores as a predefined structure.

For calculating the BGe scores use the file pre_scores_gaussian.m. 
In this file first the prior information is calculated by Compute_Prior_info.m
and then the Scores are computed by the function SBmcmc_MakeScoreStructureGaussian.m.

For more information about how the scores are calculated and how to set the parameters
type help SBmcmc_MakeScoreStructureGaussian.

This is a implementation of bayesian scores as described in:
Geiger, D. and Heckerman, D. (1994). Learning Gaussian networks.
Proceedings of the Tenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial
Intelligence, pages 235-243.

Running Order MCMC
********************

You find the matlab files for this task in folder MCMCOrder.
The file example.m has explanations about how to run the algorithm to sample orders
and how to run the algorithm for sampling DAGs given orders.





***************************
Calculating the AUC SCORES
***************************

You find the matlab files for this task in folder DGeUGe.

There are two AUC scores, namely DGE and UGE.

For getting DGE AUC value use DGEAurocValueNoDiag2.m
For getting DGE AUC plot and value use DGERocCurveNoDiag2.m
For getting UGE AUC value use UGEAurocValueNoDiag2.m
For getting UGE AUC plot and value use UGERocCurveNoDiag2.m


All these functions need the same input: (TrajectoryMean,idxtm,LimitX,FigNumber)

TrajectoryMean: This is the posterior probability matrix. You get this matrix from a
MCMC trajectory by using the functions media.m and media_UGE.m. The function media_UGE.m 
should be used when considering only the skeleton of the network. The funcion media.m
has an option for getting the PDAG. See their help for more information.

idxtm: Index of true matrix. Should be a 2 colum matrix with each line representing an
edge A--->B.
For example the matrix [1 2; 3 1; 4 2] means the follwing edges 1-->2; 3-->1; 4-->2

LimitX: is the upper range of X-axis to be presented in the graph. Note
that the AUROC area under ROC curve will also be calculated with this
limit. This means that you can have partial AUROC values, as AUROC_x,
for any x, 0<x<=1.

FigNumber: Is the number of the produced figure. Even if a figure is not produced 
you should provide this number.
